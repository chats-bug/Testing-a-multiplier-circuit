# Testing-a-multiplier-circuit
Producing a digital system begins with a designer specifying his or her design in a high-level design language, and ends with manufacturing and shipping parts to the customer. This process involves many simulations, synthesis, and test phases. In this project the design is analyzed in RTL level design simulation.
